# hand-frequency-scraper

This repo contains the source code for
[this page](https://mwiens91.github.io/hand-frequency-scraper/).
Basically, the page takes a poker game log from [Poker Now](pokernow.club/)
and spits out some visualizations of what hands you were dealt.

It's not possible to preview without having a log, but you can check out
a quick demo video I made that shows off the page [here](https://youtu.be/jcAG_KKbNbY).

Thanks to @tremby for regex help.

## Tech

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for any of the interactive visualizations.
[pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) for templating.
Some [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.
